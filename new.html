          Hey Betu , Happy Rose Day! üåπ 
          <br/>
          Just wanted to let you
          know how much you mean to me. Your presence is like sunshine in my
          life, bringing joy and warmth. Your laughter is my favorite melody.
          Here's a red rose, a symbol of my deep love for you. Like a beautiful
          garden, I hope our love keeps growing and blooming. You're the most
          special rose in my heart. Lots of love to you my girl
          <br />
